# YoungTube 2.0.0 - Youtube clone

## Introduction

This project is the 2nd version of my initial Youtube clone project.

The 1st project had built and developed myself from scratch without any tutorial but official documentation.

<br>

## Objective

The purpose of developing this 2nd version is to enhance and refactor based on new knowledge I gained from video materials.

<br>

## Development plan for version 2.0.0 enhancement based on version 1.0.0 - WIP with commit links

- [implement axios](https://github.com/youngoose/youngtube-2.0/commit/1f807d829707317d54f80689031a339799dff9c0)
- [hide key to .env and use it with axios](https://github.com/youngoose/youngtube-2.0/commit/1f807d829707317d54f80689031a339799dff9c0)
- [add context API to wrap the global state using class](https://github.com/youngoose/youngtube-2.0/pull/5)
- re-use the video component
- add unit tests

Great to implment for 3.0.0
- add typescript

- add Node and express as backend
